# Engeto Project 1 - SQL data handling process

The purpose of this project is practice data preparation. We received information about current Covid-19 situation around the world, along with information about particular countries, distributed into various tables. The process could be described as case study, where we are creating dataset along with requirements of data scientist, for example for further predictive analysis.

## Work notes:

- Data through all tables are not consistent. for example - in case of weather table, we have measurements only from european cities. Therefore, there would be incomplete description vast majority of world's countries.
